**_Flight Paths -_ Bezier curve generation with Gaussian noise, deduction of original curve using steepest descent method, and plotting/analysis of all data**

This was my final project for my Numerical Analysis I class at UCSB, one of my last upper division courses. This project was done as a group, but having the prior experience I wrote the code and found the necessary formulas. We were required to report on it individually.

Now that I have more time my intention is to take the original work and clean it up, making it more dynamic, readable, and easier to use in the process.
